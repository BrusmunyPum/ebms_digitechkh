# BMS Implementation Task Backlog

**Purpose:** a junior-friendly, ordered task list. Complete one task at a time. Do not start a task marked as blocked.

## Working rules

- Create a Git branch for each task: `feature/BMS-###-short-name`.
- Every task must have a short pull request description, tests, and a manual check before it is marked done.
- Keep commits small and named by task ID, for example: `BMS-012 add customer migration`.
- Do not build a screen that has no API contract or database support.
- When a task feels too large, stop and split it before coding.

## Milestone 0 — Development foundation

**Local development assumption:** PostgreSQL, Java, Node.js, Angular tooling, and Git are already installed on the developer computer. Use a local development database with non-production data. Docker, Nginx, staging, and production deployment are intentionally deferred to Milestone 8.

| ID | Task | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| BMS-001 | Create Git repository and initial README | — | Repository has `main`, `.gitignore`, README, and the existing docs committed. |
| BMS-002 | Add project folder structure | BMS-001 | `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `infra/compose`, and `infra/nginx` exist with README files explaining their purpose. |
| BMS-003 | Create local PostgreSQL development database | BMS-002 | A local `bms_dev` database and non-production application account exist; connection values are kept outside Git. |
| BMS-004 | Create Spring Boot API application | BMS-002 | API starts locally and exposes unauthenticated `GET /actuator/health` returning UP. |
| BMS-005 | Connect API to PostgreSQL | BMS-003, BMS-004 | API starts against the Compose database using environment variables only. |
| BMS-006 | Add Flyway and baseline migration | BMS-005 | A fresh database is migrated automatically and Flyway history records the migration. |
| BMS-007 | Create Angular web application | BMS-002 | Web app runs locally and displays a basic BMS page. |
| BMS-008 | Configure web-to-API local development proxy | BMS-004, BMS-007 | Browser can call an API health endpoint without CORS errors. |
| BMS-009 | Add code formatting and basic quality checks | BMS-004, BMS-007 | One command checks API tests and one command checks web tests/linting. |
| BMS-010A | Create local environment template | BMS-003, BMS-005, BMS-007 | `.env.example` documents every required local variable with safe placeholder values; `.env` is ignored by Git. |
| BMS-010B | Create local developer start guide | BMS-010A | README gives exact commands to start, stop, reset, and verify the local web, API, and database services. |
| BMS-010C | Document local configuration and secret rules | BMS-010A | Local variable names are documented; passwords and secret files are excluded from Git. |

**Milestone review:** from a clean clone, another developer can create the local database and start the API and web app by following the README.

## Milestone 1 — Identity, authorization, and audit

| ID | Task | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| BMS-011 | Create user, role, and user-role migrations | BMS-006 | Tables, keys, uniqueness rules, and timestamps exist; migration runs on a clean database. |
| BMS-012 | Seed administrator role and development administrator | BMS-011 | A documented development-only account can log in; production credentials are not in source control. |
| BMS-013 | Implement password hashing and login endpoint | BMS-011 | Correct credentials log in; incorrect and inactive-user attempts fail safely. |
| BMS-014 | Implement session, logout, and CSRF protection | BMS-013 | Login creates an HttpOnly session; logout invalidates it; state-changing requests without CSRF are rejected. |
| BMS-015 | Define permission names and endpoint authorization | BMS-011 | Permissions such as customer read/create/update are checked by API tests. |
| BMS-016 | Implement current-user endpoint | BMS-014, BMS-015 | `GET /api/v1/me` returns identity and permissions for a logged-in user only. |
| BMS-017 | Create audit-event migration and audit service | BMS-006 | Auditable operations create immutable events without secrets. |
| BMS-018 | Build Angular login page and auth guard | BMS-007, BMS-013, BMS-016 | A user can log in, log out, and cannot open protected routes while logged out. |
| BMS-019 | Build application shell and permission-aware navigation | BMS-018 | Navigation is shown only for allowed modules; API remains the authority. |

**Milestone review:** demonstrate login, a forbidden API request (403), logout, and an audit event.

## Milestone 2 — Shared application capabilities

| BMS-022 | Implement document-number sequence service | BMS-006 | Concurrent requests receive unique numbers; numbers never use `MAX()+1`. |
| BMS-023 | Implement idempotency-record storage and service | BMS-006 | Repeating a request with the same key returns the original result and does not run the action twice. |

| BMS-025 | Create company-settings migration and API | BMS-020, BMS-017 | An authorized admin can read/update settings; changes are audited. |

## First task to start now

Start with **BMS-001**. Do not jump to invoice or stock features. When BMS-001 through BMS-010 are complete, begin BMS-011.
